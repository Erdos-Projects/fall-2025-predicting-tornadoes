High power lines were downed, and numerous outbuilding were destroyed on the state border. The tornado then struck a house 1.5 miles northwest of Catesby. Approximately 75 percent of the roof and the north side wall of the upstairs attic were blown off. A nearby windmill was also knocked down. The tornado then continued northeast and struck another house 6 miles northeast of Catesby, very close to US 283 and the Ellis/Harper County line. Approximately 75 percent of the roof was blown off; outbuildings were destroyed; a porch was damaged, and trees were partially stripped of their limbs. As the tornado moved into Harper County, a hog barn near the Ellis/Harper County line received minor roof damage, while power lines in southern Harper County were blown down near the intersection of US 283 and US 270. The tornado is then believed to have dissipated in the North Canadian River valley about 5 miles southeast of Laverne.

Dozens of large, mature trees were stripped of most limbs, and many others were pushed over mostly in a northwestward direction, but not lofted. Then at the intersection of State Highway 45 and NS246 Road the property of the Green Valley Church sustained massive damage, most significant of which occurred to the community center, a 40 foot by 20 foot wooden structure that was completely destroyed. All exterior walls, 4 total, and the 2 interior walls were made of wood and entirely displaced from the foundation with debris located near the west edge of the foundation extending northwestward about 100 feet. On the same lot, just west and north of the community center, 3 to 4 large mature trees were either pushed over to the west and northwest or largely stripped of their limbs. The roof of the parsonage located approximately 50 feet north of the community center and just north of 2 pushed-over trees, also was heavily damaged. A 15 foot section of the gable-style roof was blown off the back side of the house and lofted eastward about 50 feet. Two large mature trees located northeast of the house were pushed over in a north-northwestward direction. Lesser damage on the property occurred to the garage, located immediately northeast of the community center, where several windows were broken and numerous roof shingles were missing. Several large bales of hay also rolled westward approximately 125 feet and were embedded in structure and tree debris. Damage to the Green Valley Community Center 6 miles SSW of Dacoma is the basis for the F2 rating. As the accompanying photo (below listing of tornado at 2225 CST) shows, this building was completely destroyed with most of the debris found to the northwest of the foundation. As the tornado tracked northeastward, a 1 mile long path of tree damage was evident on both sides of EW29 Road. Most trees had numerous limbs blown off or were damaged, while fewer trees were blown over, with the majority of trees north of the road blown over to the north and trees south of the road blown over to the east. Minor structural damage was also observed about 1/4 mile south of EW29 Road. Along NS249 Road an uninhabited house sustained significant damage to the east portion thought to be a garage, which was pushed over to the north. Numerous shingles were missing from the remainder of the house roof. A flag pole on the west side of the lot was bent to the northwest, while dozens of large mature trees north and northeast of the house were heavily damaged, with most of the them missing numerous limbs, while others were pushed over. This tree damage continued northward to EW27 Road. On the southeast side of Dacoma, an old barn was blown over, while another barn of tin construction had part of its roof blown off, with debris scattered northward a short distance. The tornado dissipated 1 mile east-northeast of Dacoma where 3-4 inch diameter tree limbs were downed.",PDC

Then during the early morning hours of the 26th, a line of severe thunderstorms formed across southwest Oklahoma and raced eastward into southeast Oklahoma, resulting in widespread damage from winds estimated between 80 and 100 mph at times.","This tornado, rated F1, touched down about 5 miles east of Carmen about ½ mile south of the intersection of EW29 Road and NS260 Road in Alfalfa County where scattered damage to trees was observed. At the intersection of EW29 Road and NS260 Road, very large limbs, some a foot or more in diameter, were blown off dozens of trees, while numerous other trees were pushed over. There was also damage to an oil storage tank made of metal. A telephone pole at the intersection was recently replaced and is assumed to have been downed during the tornado. A west to east chain link fence approximately 100 to 200 feet long was also downed southward. Major tree damage was then observed at a property about ½ mile northeast of this location with many trees laying in a westward direction. A well-designed brick home near the trees, lost dozens perhaps hundreds of shingles, especially on the west side of the house. About 1 mile northeast of this location another house sustained a broken window on the north side of the house and minor roof damage, consisting mostly of missing roof shingles. Metal siding was partially peeled back from a nearby storage barn, and a medium-aged pine tree on the west side of the house was snapped halfway to the top. Near the intersection of EW27 Road and NS262 Road damage was observed to 2 metal barns. One barn had sheet metal peeled back on the roof and west and east sides. The roof of a storage building was also blown off in an eastward direction and left nearly intact on the ground. About ½ to 1 mile north and east of this location a poorly constructed barn sustained minor roof and west-side wall damage, while another barn constructed of metal had its 2 west-facing doors blown inward and partially detached from its hinges. Continuing northward trees sustained major damage, and a grain storage silo was tossed a short distance eastward from its original location. The last area of damage was observed about ½ mile north of US Highway 64 on NS264 Road where 4 pieces of sheet metal were blown off a storage barn.",PDC

Most affected were the housing subdivisions of Woodland Park and Joseyville on the south side of Apache, where approximately 12 families needed to be rescued from trees and roofs, which were surrounded by 7 feet of water in spots.

At times water flowed very quickly, pushing and dragging large debris including mobile homes, vehicles, and boats considerable distances. Massive damage was also sustained to Apache Elementary and Middle Schools.Much of downtown Anadarko also flooded with a foot or more of water observed in spots. An estimated 20 homes were destroyed by the flooding, while 60 homes sustained major damage, and 12 apartments and 8 businesses sustained minor damage.
