The tornado caused most of its damage in the Valencia neighborhood. It was here that many homes sustained roof, window, garage door, and fence damage. One home sustained especially heavy damage, with a large portion of the roof being lost and extensive damage to the inside of the home. The tornado continued northeast and appeared to have dissipated just northeast of the subdivision, where some tree damage was noted. After a gap, additional damage was observed near the intersection of NW 192nd Street and Western Avenue, where several large power transmission poles were blown down, and some fence damage was also observed. While there was not a continuous damage path between the two damage sites, they do appear to be in line with the storm's path.
