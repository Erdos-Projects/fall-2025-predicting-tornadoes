As with earlier tornadoes, much of the damage in this area may have been the result of strong straight-line winds, although the concentration and severity of damage in this area suggests a probable tornadic spin up.In the Deer Creek area, 135 homes sustained minor damage, 7 major damage, and 7 homes were destroyed. Six mobile homes were damaged. Three were reported to have minor damage, while three others sustained major damage. Two businesses were also destroyed. The Deer Creek/Edmond public school received damage along with the First Baptist Church which was heavily damaged.",PDS
