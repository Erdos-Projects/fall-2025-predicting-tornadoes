An upper level low pressure remained anchored over Colorado during this time period. Surface low pressure was located over southeast Colorado, with a dryline extending south along the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle border. Outflow boundaries were also present from previous thunderstorm activity. These boundaries were important in the formation of thunderstorms throughout the day. Moisture was in abundance that day, along with very strong instability. Wind shear remained quite favorable for supercell thunderstorms. Most of the thunderstorms began over the northwest half of Oklahoma, but moved south and east into the morning and afternoon hours of the 7th.  Large hail, high winds, and tornadoes were common, with flooding rains also present.  One small supercell thunderstorm developed east of the main thunderstorm area during the evening and produced two small tornadoes as it moved to the north. Two other tornadoes occurred in the early morning hours as thunderstorms moving northeast into central Oklahoma interacted with gust front boundaries from previous thunderstorms.","This tornado occurred within the city limits of Oklahoma City.  A narrow path of considerable tree damage was found from just northwest of the intersection of NE 36th Street and Martin Luther King Avenue to just east of the intersection of Interstate 35 and NE 50th Street, including a swath about 30 yards wide across Lincoln Park Golf Course.  Damage consisted of numerous small to medium branches broken off trees, as well as numerous large rotted branches. A number of small trees in wet soil were also pushed over along this path.  Minor shingle damage was noted to a home just east of I-35 and NE 50th Street, and minor gutter damage was noted to a large metal building just to the southwest of the house. A couple of wooden fences were pushed over and a small canopy was torn near the start of the path. However other structures in or near the path showed little discernible damage. Monetary damages were estimated.",CSV
